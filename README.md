Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project created by Pruthvi Bhaskar Tadala.

# Data
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# Files
•	CodeBook.md , a code book file that provides brief description about the data, variables and  transformations that I did to perform the data cleansing.

# Steps :
1.	Run_analysis.R has the code that performs the necessary data preparation followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
a.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
b.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
c.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
d.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
e.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

•	FinalData.txt is the final data obtained after performing the above sequences.
